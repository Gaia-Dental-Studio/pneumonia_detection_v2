# Pneumonia Detection

This model was trained with CNN architecture on a [Pneumonia chest x-ray image](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) and [Tuberculosis chest x-ray image](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/tuberculosis-tb-chest-xray-dataset) using Keras. The model is trained to classify X-ray images into three categories: Pneumonia TBC, Pneumonia non-TBC, and Normal. 

The newest trained model with accuracy 99,1% can be accessed on this [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1--ThJOloeL444-PCdbQzsEkltjkp9zGD/view?usp=drive_link).
